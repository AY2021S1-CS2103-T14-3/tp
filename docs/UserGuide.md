## Goto

The goto command is used to navigate to various directories within the travel planner. The GUI display depends on the 
state of the current directory, which is changed using the goto command. On start, the default directory of the program 
is `wishlist`.<br/>
<br/>

>Directories in Wanderlust include: 
>1. `wishlist`
>2. `NAME_OF_TRAVEL_PLAN`<br/>

<br/>
This allows users to easily add, delete, view and edit information within the wishlist or a specific travel plan without 
having to type their names in each command. This also means that **some commands can only be used locally within a 
certain directory, and responses to these commands will depend on the current directory.** Commands that can be used 
globally and locally are tagged (G) and (L) respectively in the **features section** of this user guide. <br/>
