## Project: Wanderlust

WanderLust is a desktop travel-planning application that allows users to plan their trips in a structured and efficient 
manner. It is optimised for CLI-proficient users, and comes with a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and 
has approximately 16 kLOC. 

This application is part of my team project for an Introduction to Software Engineering (CS2103) module taken at NUS.
